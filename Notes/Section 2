Section 2

When going to a website, first create an HTTP request, sent to the website, their server determines what material I need, then they send me HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that my browser interprets.

I only ever see HTML, CSS, and JS. This is front-end (client-side), all the logic (figuring out my login info, how to structure, what material is included) is the backend.

Dynamic websites will change when a user does something (adds a review) vs a static webpage that will only update when the developer updates it.

HTML: Hypertext Markup Language
-"nouns" of a webpage
	-Put it here, do this here, etc

CSS: Cascading Style Sheets
-Styles existing HTML
-"Adjectives"
	-Make this paragraph this color

JavaScript
-Adds logic and iteractivity
-"Verbs"
