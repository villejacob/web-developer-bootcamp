Section 20

OBJECTIVES
	1. Review Internet Basics
	2. Static vs Dynamic Sites
	3. Stacks/Back End Technologies


STATIC vs DYNAMIC
	
	Dynamic

		Compiled on the server side, where the server is constructing the web page before sent back as a response
		Can send back different content every time

	Static

		Same content each time, server doesn't need to do anything but send the original files


STACKS

	Backend Language / app
	server
	Database

	Example: Reddit's Stack

		Python / Flask
		nginx
		postgresql


OUR STACK

	Back-end
		Node JS - Javascript for the backent
		Express - Framework
		MongoDB - Database

	Front-end
		HTML
		CSS
		JS


Frontend and Backend sequence of events example:

	1. Ask for reddit homepage 	->
							   		<- 	2. 	Get top posts from DB
									 	send back to home page
	3. Browser renders homepage
	4. User enters "dogs" in
	   in search and submits	->
	   								<- 	5. 	Finds all posts in database about "dogs"
	   								<- 	6. 	Sends back HTML for the search results page
	7. Browser renders search page



HTTP REQUESTS IN DEPTH

	Request / Response cycle

	Can make requests from anywhere, independent of browser

	HTTP Verbs - Types of requests
		Tell the server what we want to do

	URL query: begins after ? name=value & name2=value2 &...


BACKEND WORKFLOW

	Starts with serverside JS code
	Run in terminal
	Browser to visit url
