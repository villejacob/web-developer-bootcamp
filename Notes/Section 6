Section 6

OBJECTIVES
	1. Manipulate font and text properties in CSS
	2. Include external fonts
	3. Box model

Projects:
	Tic Tac Toe
	Image Gallery portfolio site
	Minimalist Blog Site

font-family:
	font-family: "font_name";

font-size:
	font-size: 	_px;
				_em;

em is a relative font size.
	2em would be 2x the parent element
	Initial size changes based on the browser (~60px)
	good practice to define body font

Note: Use span to define text in line

font-weight:
	How thick the lines will be
	font-weight: bold;

some fonts will allow numerical values between 100 - 800
	(100, 200, 300, etc)

line-height:
	spacing
	line-height: 2;
	2 meaning it is 2x the font size

text-align:
	text-align: center;
	center, left, right

text-decoration:
	underline, line-through, etc
	text-decoration: underline;


CUSTOM FONTS

google fonts: google.com/fonts
	"add to collection"
	"use"
	decide font weights
	copy link, put in head

to use:
h1 {
	font-family: Indie Flower;
}


THE BOX MODEL

Every element has a rectangular box around it
(can see when using developer tools)

FOUR PROPERTIES:
	Content
	Padding
		between content and border
	Border
	Margin
		between border and others

Note: 	if percents, it is 50% of what it is inside (dynamic)
		padding: on all four sides
				to specify: border-top: etc
							padding-left: 40px;
		margin: top right bottom left;
				auto: centers an element

Exercise: Tic Tac Toe 

Exercise: Portfolio 

To make divs go side-by-side:
	FLOAT:
		float: left;
		// They float to the left of what is above, instead of below
		Also gets rid of default whitespace

Exercise: Minimalist blog

rem: sets to root element instead of head (dont worry about nesting)
