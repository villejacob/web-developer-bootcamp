Section 7

OBJECTIVES
	1. Define Bootstrap
	2. Include Bootstrap locally
	3. Use common components like navbars and components
	4. Build layout using grid

Best to use to quickly demo front end

Can use either downloaded or external file

Use different classes to specify elements

Active class:
	just add the class "active"
	Darker shading to indicate active

COMPONENTS

Jumbotron - huge display
	just use class="jumbotron"
	initially takes up whole screen
	use grid system to make it less

Container
	default centered with some spacing

Forms
	form-control allows lego-like usage
	form-group makes spacing look nice
	form-inline

Navbar
	can use container within navbar to allow centered content
	When using default, need Bootstrap js to work

	To make our simple navbar collapse:
		put in div with class "collapse navbar-collapse"
	Add in hamburger:
		add button with class navbar-toggle collapsed in navbar-header
		id of button must match id of nav navbar-nav
		If outside of collapse
			They stay listed below and are not collapsed

GRID SYSTEM
	beside each other, then when collapsed they stack
	12 columns, then choose how many of 12 an item takes up
	Ex: <div class="col-md-3"></div>

column sizes:
	xs: mobile
	sm: tablet
	md: laptop
	lg: desktop

	add class for each size
	if size is the same, don't need md and lg, just md

Nested grids:
	Must be within a row, can't be within just a column


Project: Image Gallery

Need to specify border around an image

Thumbnail
	class=thumbnail around image

Icons
	called glyphs
	span with the class

To make navbar stay to the top, add class navbar-fixed-top
	Now add 70px padding to the top

Code Along: Purrfect Match landing page

Image properties: 
	Cover will take up the whole document
	but the body itself is not the full screen
	html height to 100%

Text shadow:
	text-shadow: offset-x, offset-y, blur-radius, color
