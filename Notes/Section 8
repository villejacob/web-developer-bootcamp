Section 8

OBJECTIVES
	1. Run JS in the developer console
	2. 5 primitive data types
	3. Define and reference variables
	4. Write code using console.log, alert, and prompt

Developer console:
	Interact/test first, then implement in js file

Javascript basics:

5 PRIMITIVE DATATYPES
	Numbers
		4
		9.3
		-10
		Does not separate into int, long, etc
	Strings
		"Hello World"
		"43"
		Inside of quotes
	Booleans
		true
		false
	null and undefined
		null
		undefined

NUMBERS
	Enter in a number, returns
	Takes in simple operations
	Follows order of operations

STRINGS
	Treats single and double quotes the same
	But they must match
	Can be nested
		"I can't stop eating"
		'I can't stop' :: INVALID
	Concatenation
		"hi" + "goodbye"
	Escape character: \
		Want: She said "goodbye"
		Do: "She said \"goodbye\""
	length property
		.length
		Note: no parenthesis
		Counts characters
	Access like an array:
		"The Beatles"[0]
		-> T
		Last character:
			"The Beatles"[.length-1]

Concept check:
	1. 100 % 3 = 1
	2. ("blah" + "blah")[6] = 'a'
	3. "hello".length % "hi\\".length = 5 % 3 = 2


VARIABLES
	Named container that stores values
	syntax:
		var variable_name = variable_value;
	Examples:
		var name = "Rusty";
		var secretNumber = 73;
		var isAdorable = true;
	Do not need to declare variable type
	Changing variable type (Dynamic typing)
		var num = 50;
		num = "fifty";
	Naming convention: camelCase

UNDEFINED
	Declared but not initialized
	var age;

NULL
	var currentPlayer = "charlie";
	currentPlayer = null;


METHODS

clear() - clears the current window

alert
	pops up message to user
	alert()
		in parenthesis, put datatype

console.log()
	prints to the console
		in parenthesis, put whatever

prompt("what is your name?")
	Asks user for input
	stores as variable
	Ex: var userName = prompt("what is your name"0);
	now userName is whatever the user entered

JS Stalker Exercise
	- ask for first name
	- ask for last name
	- ask for age
	To console:
	- print out users full name in a sentence
	- print out the users age in a sentence
